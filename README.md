# Web Scraping and Data Analysis: Mars Exploration Project

## Background:
This project involves web scraping and data analysis related to Mars exploration. The goal is to extract information from the Mars News website and analyze Mars weather data to gain insights into the Martian environment.

### Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

Automated browsing is used to visit the Mars news site, and HTML code is extracted using Beautiful Soup.
Titles and preview text of news articles are scraped and stored in Python data structures.
Optionally, scraped data is exported to a JSON file.

### Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

Automated browsing is used to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site, and HTML table data is extracted using Beautiful Soup.
The extracted data is assembled into a Pandas DataFrame with appropriate column headings and data types.
Data analysis is performed to answer questions about Mars weather, including the number of months on Mars, the coldest and warmest months, atmospheric pressure variations, and Martian year duration.
The DataFrame is exported to a CSV file.# Data_Collection
